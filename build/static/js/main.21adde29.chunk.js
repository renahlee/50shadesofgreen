The lack of variation in our raw data set may yield a CNN model that does not generalize well.","In particular, target leakage of background pixels is a primary concern. Every seedling image is taken against a background of pebbles and/or a measuring stick. Different species of seedlings have different sizes at the same growth stage, meaning that pictures of smaller species will have a higher zoom level. A CNN can use the relative scale of the pebbles or measuring stick to classify the seedlings instead of using the features of the seedlings themselves. This is a problem because test data sets in the real world may have the seedlings against different types of backgrounds.","Another issue with this data set is an imbalance of class sizes. There are three crop species compared to nine weed species, and the number of images per species ranges from 253 to 762.

Therefore, we decided to employ unsupervised learning to segment the plant leaves from the background before training our supervised learners.  Without ground truth values for the plant body within the original dataset, our goals for unsupervised segmentation were to extract clear-enough leaves for passing to the supervised classifiers.","Intuitively, clustering within color-space presented the best option, since the target is fairly different from the background.  Since image color information is a bounded, continuous space, we decided that hard assignment along the color-information axes (and not spatial axes) would be sufficient and much more performant.  Therefore, we decided upon k-means clustering as our segmentation technique.  However, this posed three research questions:","1. Which color space is best to quantize?\n1. What is the optimal number of cluster centers to segment out the plant body?\n1. How do we avoid mislabeling due to reflectance and illumination changes?","For the first research question, we compared plant body segmentation for the quantization of all color channels within RGB-space to the hue channel within HSV-space. To do so, we used the elbow method to generate a putative range of the number of clusters for each space, and then visually confirmed that segmentation would produce a cluster centroid corresponding to a plant body.

To resolve this, we investigated two processes: (1) thresholding, which is a pre-process that removes all near-white pixels before segmentation, and (2) cascading segmentation, which implements two rounds of segmentation within alternating color spaces.","Once our images are pre-processed, we can implement k-means clustering upon just the relevant channels.  The resultant image can be processed with non-green suppression to extract the pixels corresponding to the plant body before passing the processed images to the supervised learners.

In the investigation, Random Forest models were created for both binary classification between weeds and crops, as well as classification between the comprehensive list of labels.  Since images were segmented through k-means, models were also trained on the segmented images.","In order to train the Random Forest model, features need to be extracted that differentiate between images. Pixel color histograms were generated for the color images, as well as pixel intensities for grayscale images.  Bin values were then extracted as linear features.  In addition, multidimensional histograms using AND logic were created for the red, green, and blue-values as well:  One for all three together and two for red/green and blue/green.  For example, one bin would be for how many pixels have red, green and blue values between 0 and 10. The histograms can be seen plotted below:","### Neural network classifier","We aim to develop a CNN image classifier that yields accurate results without a resource or time-intensive training process; all while dealing with the issues inherent in this dataset. To address the class imbalance, we create a balanced dataset by undersampling all classes down to 253 images per species. We create a training set and a testing set using an 80/20 split. We use 80% of the training set for training and 20% for validation. These splits yield 1948 training images, 488 validation images, and 600 testing images. To compensate for this relatively small dataset, we use the Xception model architecture and use initial weights that have been trained on the ImageNet dataset.","The model was trained using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.0001 for 60 epochs. Training data was fed to the model in batches of 32 images. After each epoch, the validation accuracy was calculated. If the validation accuracy did not improve for three consecutive epochs, the learning rate was reduced by a factor of \u2155 with a minimum possible learning rate of 0.000001. If the validation accuracy did not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, training was ended and the model was saved with the weights that yielded the highest validation accuracy.","This training procedure was repeated to train a model using the segmented images created by the process described above.

However it performs worse when using the segmented images. The most potential with this model would be for classifying between crops and weeds because that is where it had its best performance.

For example, while the pipeline produces a single mask upon all plant body pixels, it would be useful to extract individual leaves and stems to determine plant body geometry and structure.","One possible avenue for future work would involve using edge detection, such as with Sobel filters or Canny Edge Detector, since edge images represent a higher level of abstraction.  In addition, edges are feature invariant to absolute illumination. This could reduce overfitting of classifiers to one particular lighting condition.  Edge detection in combination with gradient convolutions would allow for calculating relative orientations of the leaves and stems.","Another possible avenue to explore is to cascade-segment upon different features within HSV space, such as saturation values in order to reduce noise.  Similarly, noise removal filtering with Wiener filters could also reduce overall noise.","For the random forest classification, further work can be done with feature extraction. The key to a good random forest classifier is good features. The histograms we used are a solid foundation that can be expanded upon. Other measures of the images could be found and used to help differentiate them.","Further work is needed to assess the quality of the CNN-based classifiers. In order to test how well these models generalize, a new test set should be constructed that consists of seedling images of the 12 species that were not taken in the controlled environment of the Aarhaus University labs. The impact of different backgrounds and viewing angles on prediction quality must be considered before applying these classifiers to any practical problems.","One possible avenue to improve model performance for both the unsegmented and segmented models is a cascading classifier. This classifier consists of several trained neural networks that progressively discriminate an image into increasingly granular classes."]}]}],A=function(){return s.a.createElement(r.a,{theme:c},s.a.createElement(l.a,{px:5},s.a.createElement(l.b,{color:c.colors.green,fontFamily:"Nanum Gothic",fontSize:"4rem",fontWeight:"normal",pt:4,pb:2},"50 shades of green \ud83c\udf3f"),s.a.createElement(l.d,{color:c.colors.grey,fontSize:"0.8em",pb:5},"Samuel Elkind, Ollie Hsieh, Michael Liang, Nick Martucci, Matt Redington"),H.map((function(e,t){return s.a.createElement(d,{index:t,heading:e.heading,sections:e.sections})}))),s.a.createElement("div",{id:"leaves"},s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null),s.a.createElement("i",null)))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));o.a.render(s.a.createElement(s.a.StrictMode,null,s.a.createElement(A,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))},39:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure1_1.6e004a1f.png"},40:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_15.1be00a33.png"},41:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_21.7a88e93f.png"},42:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_23.a49ccc5d.png"},43:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_25.037703dd.png"},44:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_27.d73ede9c.png"},45:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_28.1e74e6c2.png"},46:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_29.6ad8e627.png"},47:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_30.140cd425.png"},48:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_31.0999da7e.png"},49:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/media/Figure3_32.c7896b2f.png"},50:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(140)}},[[50,1,2]]]);
