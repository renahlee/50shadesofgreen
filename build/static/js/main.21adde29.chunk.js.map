This model achieved 99.74% accuracy on the augmented test set. While impressive, this model took 99 hours to train, not including augmented dataset creation, making this approach infeasible for real-world applications. Since agricultural needs vary widely, a cheaper approach would allow each cultivator to produce a classification model trained on relevant crop and weed species in the environment in which the model will be applied; yielding better results.\",\n        \"Kaggle user “Marsh” takes the opposite approach. Citing the class imbalance present in the dataset, they seek to train an effective model by downsampling the over-represented plant species to 250 images per species. A custom architecture was used with randomly initialized weights. After 40 training epochs, this model correctly classified 79% of the test set. The smaller training set and light-weight architecture resulted in a drastically shorter training time of 400 seconds.\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      text: [\n        \"## 🌱 Research objectives\",\n        \"Generally, the current practice for weed identification uses a CNN to classify images. The quality of the produced model depends heavily on the quality of the data set.

The lack of variation in our raw data set may yield a CNN model that does not generalize well.\",\n        \"In particular, target leakage of background pixels is a primary concern. Every seedling image is taken against a background of pebbles and/or a measuring stick. Different species of seedlings have different sizes at the same growth stage, meaning that pictures of smaller species will have a higher zoom level. A CNN can use the relative scale of the pebbles or measuring stick to classify the seedlings instead of using the features of the seedlings themselves. This is a problem because test data sets in the real world may have the seedlings against different types of backgrounds.\",\n        \"Another issue with this data set is an imbalance of class sizes. There are three crop species compared to nine weed species, and the number of images per species ranges from 253 to 762. The least represented species is common wheat, a cash crop whose correct classification is essential for industry.

Therefore, we decided upon k-means clustering as our segmentation technique.  However, this posed three research questions:\",\n        \"1.
